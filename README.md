# Ayase Chihaya

***

A Discord Bot for personal use.

***

## Usage

Usage here

```bash

```

## Environment Variables

It will eventually require these:

- `TOKEN` - Discord Bot Token
- `OWNER` - User ID of bot owner. Should be whoever is deploying the bot.
- `PREFIX` - The bot prefix. Can be `.` or even `yeet` or whatever the fuck you want.
- `COLOUR` - Embed colour represented by integer value.
- `AVATAR` - Not the bot avatar actually. It's just the image that appears on a buncha embeds.

## Random Bullshit

The bot is uhhhhhhh very much specialized to my very specific needs. If you're not in the servers it's built for, you'll have to take some extra steps.
